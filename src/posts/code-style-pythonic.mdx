## Zen of Python

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than right now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Line Length

A single line should not exceed the number of 79 characters, whereas a docstring or comment is no longer than 72 characters. Lines of code can be wrapped by using a backslash (\) as follows:

Code with a Line-Break


```python
with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
     open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
    file_2.write(file_1.read())
```
 or
```python
value = (foo.bar()['first'][0]*baz.ham(1, 2)[5:9]
        + verify(34, 20)*skip(500, 360))
```

## Credibility

```python
a = 10
b = 1000
total_sum = 0while b >= a:
    total_sum += a
    a += 1
```

```python
total_sum = sum(range(10, 1001))
```

This single line of code generates the exact same result as above (for the record, I did intend to write 1001 in the code as Python’s range command has an inclusive lower bound and a non-inclusive upper bound,
meaning the lower number will be a part of the loop, while the higher number will not).
 If you were to write Python code using the first example, your credibility as a Python developer would go down as the Python community is very passionate about writing code following the guidelines.

## Naming conventions

Naming conventions are important for any language to provide a common means of identifying types and objects. Here’s an abridged version of the naming conventions:

- Packages/Modules: Must use all-lowercase. Underscores can be used if necessary, but are discouraged. Ex: `package` or `module.py`.
- Classes: Must use CapWords. Recommended to not use the word Class in the name. Ex: `class BasketballTeam:`.
- Constants: Must use screaming snake case. Ex: `API_URL = '...'`.
- Functions/Variables: Must use standard snake case. Ex: `home_team_points = ...` or `def final_boxscore(...)`.
- Function/Method Arguments: Must use standard snake case. Ex: `home_team_name`.

Prefer "reverse notation".

**yes**

    elements = ...
    elements_active = ...
    elements_defunct = ...

**No**

    elements = ...
    active_elements = ...
    defunct_elements ...

## Modifying the values in a list

**Bad:**

Remember that assignment never creates a new object. If two or more variables refer to the same list, changing one of them changes them all.
```python
# Add three to all list members.
a = [3, 4, 5]
b = a                     # a and b refer to the same list object

for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] += 3             # b[i] also changes
```

**Good:**

It’s safer to create a new list object and leave the original alone.

```python
a = [3, 4, 5]
b = a

# assign the variable "a" to a new list without changing "b"
a = [i + 3 for i in a]
```
Use `enumerate()` keep a count of your place in the list.
```python
a = [3, 4, 5]
for i, item in enumerate(a):
    print i, item
# prints
# 0 3
# 1 4
# 2 5
```
## Short Ways to Manipulate Lists

List comprehensions provide a powerful, concise way to work with lists.

Generator expressions follow almost the same syntax as list comprehensions but return a generator instead of a list.

Creating a new list requires more work and uses more memory. If you are just going to loop through the new list, prefer using an iterator instead.

If your logic is too complicated for a short list comprehension or generator expression, consider using a generator function instead of returning a list.

```python
def make_batches(items, batch_size):
    """
    >>> list(make_batches([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], batch_size=3))
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    """
    current_batch = []
    for item in items:
        current_batch.append(item)
        if len(current_batch) == batch_size:
            yield current_batch
            current_batch = []
    yield current_batch
```

## List Comprehension vs Generator Expressions

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import sys

l = [n*2 for n in range(1000)] # List comprehension
g = (n*2 for n in range(1000)) # Generator expression

print(type(l))  # <type 'list'>
print(type(g))  # <type 'generator'>

print(sys.getsizeof(l))  # 9032
print(sys.getsizeof(g))  # 80

print(l[4])   # 8
#print(g[4])   # TypeError: 'generator' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

for v in l:
    pass
for v in g:
    pass
```

The generator yields one item at a time and generates item only when in demand. Whereas, in a list comprehension, Python reserves memory for the whole list. Thus we can say that the generator expressions are memory efficient than the lists

There is a remarkable difference in the execution time. Thus, generator expressions are faster than list comprehension and hence time efficient.


## Merging dictionaries

```python
dict1 = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
dict2 = { 'b': 3, 'c': 4 }
merged = { **dict1, **dict2 }
print (merged)
# {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
If there are overlapping keys, the keys from the first dictionary will be overwritten

## Slicing a list

The basic syntax of list slicing is:

    a[start:stop:step]

Start, stop and step are optional. If you don’t fill them in, they will default to:

- 0 for `start`
- the end of the string for `stop`
- 1 for `step`

```python
# We can easily create a new list from
# the first two elements of a list:
first_two = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5][0:2]
print(first_two)
# [1, 2]

# And if we use a step value of 2,
# we can skip over every second number
# like this:
steps = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5][0:5:2]
print(steps)
# [1, 3, 5]

# This works on strings too. In Python,
# you can treat a string like a list of
# letters:
mystring = "abcdefdn nimt"[::2]
print(mystring)
# 'aced it'
```

## Using map()

One of Python’s built-in functions is called map(). The syntax for map() is:

    map(function, something_iterable)

So you give it a function to execute, and something to execute on. This can be anything that’s iterable. In the examples below I’ll use a list.

```python
def upper(s):
    return s.upper()

mylist = list(map(upper, ['sentence', 'fragment']))
print(mylist)
# ['SENTENCE', 'FRAGMENT']

# Convert a string representation of
# a number into a list of ints.
list_of_ints = list(map(int, "1234567")))
print(list_of_ints)
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

## Ternary operator

This is another one of those ways to make your code more concise while still keeping it readable:

    [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]

As an example:

    x = "Success!" if (y == 2) else "Failed!"

## String formatting

```python
data = {'day':'Saturday'}
print("{day}".format(**data))
```
or
```python
print(f"{day}")
```
## Keyword arguments

Use a leading `*` to require keyword aruments`
```python
def connect(*, user, server)
connect(user='mkennedy', server='db_server')
```
