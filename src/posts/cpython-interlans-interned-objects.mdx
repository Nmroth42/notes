In CPython 3.7 interned objects are:

- Integers ranging from -5 to 256.
- Strings containing only ASCII letters, numbers, or underscores

This is because these variables are often used in many programs. By interning, Python prevents memory allocation for persistently used objects.

```python
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 0 + 1
>>> x is y
True
```

```python
>>> s1 = "Hello world!"
>>> s2 = "Hello world!"
>>> s1 is s2
False
```

Optionally, you can use `sys.intern()` function to create custom interned string object.
By using `sys.intern()` you ensure that you never create two string objects that have the same value - when you request the creation of a second string object with the same value as an existing string object,
you receive a reference to the pre-existing string object. This way, you are saving memory.

For example, interning strings is useful to gain a little performance on dictionary lookup
 â€“ if the keys in a dictionary are interned, and the lookup key is interned, the key comparisons (after hashing) can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare.
