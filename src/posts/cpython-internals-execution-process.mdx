## What is CPython?

Python is a language. A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.
This means that it's simply the rules and syntax for writing code. Separately we have a programming language implementation.

The standard language implementation of Python is CPython.
CPython can be defined as both an interpreter and a compiler as it compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it.

## Execution Process
CPython compiles your Python source code into bytecode. That bytecode is then executed on the CPython Virtual Machine.

Note that bytecode appears at compile stage after AST.
