## Everything is an PyObject
Python objects are structures allocated on the heap. They have type PyObject.

PyObject is a C struct. Each instance of PyObject contains the variable ob_refcnt where the reference count is kept and ob_type where the type is kept.


## Python name and PyObject

In C and C++, a variable is a named memory location.
The value of the variable is the value stored in that location.
This memory location is allocated regardless of whether a value is assigned to it yet.

In Python, a variable is a name used to refer to an object.
The value of the variable is that object.

```python
 x = 0
 x = 1
```
<PythonPyobject className="excalidraw" />
This illustration demonstrates that `x` binds to an object  and does not own the memory area.

Note that `x` and `y` is immutable.


```python
>>> y = x
>>> y is x
True

>>> y += 1
>>> y is x
False
```

**Immutable** objects are "passed by value".

**Mutable** objects are "passed by reference".
